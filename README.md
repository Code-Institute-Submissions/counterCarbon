#counterCarbon

This site was created due to the fact that there is no carbon tracker centred on the Irish consumer available to use. The central ambition of the project was to make this site unlike the broad choice of carbon trackers, which are frustratingly detailed, often requiring precise input (.e.g. rate of heating oil use). The site is designed as an intuitive, user-friendly and encouraging introduction to a more carbon-conscious lifestyle. 


##UX

The site is designed for people mostly unfamiliar with emissions tracking, and with broader climate-change questions. This site is designed as their introduction to the field. 

These users only access the site to learn about their CO2 emissions, and they are guided through several straight-forward questions that result in that user's total emissions, and what those emissions are in comparison to several national averages. The emphasis is constantly on interaction and clarity; due to this focus the site is easier to navigate than its competitors such as (a) https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx (b) https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/carbon-footprint-calculator/ (c) https://footprint.wwf.org.uk/#/

The focus on clarity is made clear in the README wireframes, see. README folder. The initial wireframe sketch "counterCarbon(outline)" underscores the clean and well-spaced structure. This was chosen to make the presentation as unconfusing as possible. 

The same principles were maintained through the build, .e.g. README wireframe files "counterCarbon(desktop)" or "counterCarbon(mobile)". The questions are here outlined in a larger font and the emissions questions answered are immediately represented in an interactive bar-chart; both decisions taken to increase accessibility and broaden appeal. 

Towards the end of the build, it was decided to add a "further action" section. As on discovering the user's emissions total they might consider donating to a organisation involved or perhaps volunteering; these reactions are then attended to in the final "Partners" section. 


User Stories: 

(a) As a site visitor, I can answer the set questions so that I will learn my total CO2 emissions. 

(b) As a child site visitor, I can answer the set questions so that I will learn my total CO2 emissions through diagram/chart. 

(c) As a site visitor, I can learn my emissions total so that I can take a first step towards mitigating my impact on the climate.

(d) As a site visitor, I can contact green organisations through the site so that I can act on my emissions total. 

(e) As a member of a green organisation, I can direct the public here so that they can be introduced to the topic in an encouraging way.
